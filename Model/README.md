# Quad Music Transformer Pre-Trained Model

***

## Model is hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/asigalov61/Quad-Music-Transformer)

***

### Model training corpus is [Monster MIDI Dataset Sample Search Results](https://huggingface.co/datasets/projectlosangeles/Monster-MIDI-Dataset/blob/main/Monster_MIDI_Dataset_Search_Results_Ver_1_0_CC_BY_NC_SA.zip)

### This training corpus consists of 90k select MIDIs from [Monster MIDI Dataset](https://github.com/asigalov61/Monster-MIDI-Dataset)

### Training corpus was augmented x6 times (x2 by time and x3 by pitch), which resulted in ~540k training samples of 8k length

### Model was trained on the resulting augmented training corpus for 41 hours(1 full epoch) @ 4 batches on a single H100 GPU
